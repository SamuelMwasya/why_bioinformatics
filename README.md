The reasons for having interest to become a bioinformatician

When I joined college I wanted to pursue any course leading me to numbers only, and for that reason I ended up choosing BSc Mathematics.

Being in mathematical field,I was at ease with computation of data thus  automatically leading me to Statistics in my 3rd year. 

With the course I was introduced to coding in R and other programming language like Python and C++.  

Bioinformatics came in after realizing itâ€™s more interesting and exploring to analyze biodata than data from other fields and for that I planned my career path to be related to Bioinformatics so as to contribute to innovation in biology based technology and computation.



## Why bioinformatics internship?

I would like to nderstand how to use my mathematical/statistical strengths and skills in developing models and data management to enhance human reasoning and accelerate scientific discoveries.

To clearly understand which field of bioinformatics I am best to explore with my mathematical background and I really have interest computations and machine learning.
